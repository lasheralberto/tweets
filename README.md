I extracted data from 10.000 tweets from the past few days, where the spread of the virus is at higuest levels. However, the results of this sentiment analysis shows that the positive tweets offset the negative ones in a bigger proportion. 
Is this consequence of the advance in the pace of vaccination and the hope associated with it? If we increase the sample, or just we change the date of the tweet extraction we can stumble upon other different results.
